- ✅ Network error simulation (404, 500, timeouts)
- ✅ Performance stress testing
- ✅ Memory usage testing
- ✅ DOM manipulation testing
- ✅ Real-time error console with export capability

### 📚 Documentation

**Comprehensive Documentation:**
- ✅ `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` - Complete system documentation
- ✅ Usage examples and best practices
- ✅ Configuration options and customization
- ✅ Testing procedures and checklists
- ✅ Troubleshooting and maintenance guides

## 🚀 Key Benefits Achieved

### For Developers:
- **Zero Missed Errors**: Every error is captured and logged
