# Building Scalable Component Libraries

Creating a component library that scales requires careful planning and architectural decisions. Here's how to build components that stand the test of time.

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency** - Maintain visual and functional consistency
2. **Flexibility** - Allow customization without breaking the design
3. **Accessibility** - Build with accessibility in mind from the start
4. **Documentation** - Provide clear usage examples and guidelines

## Best Practices

### Component Composition
Instead of creating monolithic components, compose smaller, focused components together.

### Props Design
Design your props API to be intuitive and TypeScript-friendly.

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing ensures your components work reliably across different scenarios:
- Unit tests for component logic
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency
- Accessibility tests for inclusive design
